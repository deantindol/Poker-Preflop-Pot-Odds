This program provides the preflop win percantage and push (tie) percentage for two hands in Texas Hold'em.

**This is still a work in progress. 
**Documentation is unfinished and more optimization is to come.
Runs on my M2 Mac in ~3.5 seconds so slower processors might take longer. 
To run the program with keyboard input run PokerDriver.
For two random hands, run Random.

For information on the breakdown of how many possible hand ranks each player can win with, add "-l" as an argument.

To calculate odds after the flop or turn, add "-t 3" or "-t 4" as an argument.
